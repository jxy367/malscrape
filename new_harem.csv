One day while he was going home he stumbled upon a girl being bullied by magic students. He decided to intervene but before he manages to do so, the other party lost interest and left. He then went to the now alone girl and apologized on their behalf as a wizard.  The girl asked if he's a wizard and implored him to teach her magic. Naturally he refused and told her to go enroll to the magic academy. She told her that she was a student there but was expelled due to a lack of magic potential. Since magic potential is innate and can't be changed he told her to give it up and went back on his way home.  While thinking during his way home, he realized that girl look tattered and is standing near a Wizard's society building. Thinking that the girl must have been standing there for days in order to find a mentor, he decided to go back to her.  Seeing the girl still on the same place, he asked her if she really wanted to become a wizard no matter what. But before she can answer she collapsed due to exhaustion so Lazlocke took her home.  He nursed her back to health and completely recovered several days later. He then asked her to explain her situation.  Her name is Celestine Rococo, her father is the head of the Rococo family, a prestigious magic family. One day his apprentice killed him and took over as the head. In order to avenge her father and take her rightful position as the family head, she vowed to become a wizard and enrolled at the magic academy. Unfortunately she had no magic potential and the academy kicked her out after not showing progress for 3 months.  Pitiful of her plight, Lazlocke asked the society to look in her situation. The society responded by saying that the apprentice is only taking the head position temporarily and promised to step down once the rightful person has shown talents befitting that of a head. Furthermore, the society promises to acknowledge Celestine's capability as a head if she manages to win the Queenberg magic rally due in 3 years.  And thus begins Lazlocke and Celestine's mentor-apprentice relationship. Will she manage to win the fated tournament?  (Source: VNDB)",1,0,0,0,0

To this end, there is a shop that almost every student knows about, selling everything from exam cheat sheets, scouting reports for upcoming matches, photos of girls, and even things that look like love potions. In the past, good luck charms for attaining love were also sold there and were quite popular.  This shop is known as ‘gakuen seikatsu sougojo kenkyuukai’ (research society for helping each others’ school lives), shortened as ‘gojoken’. Shigeru went to check it out of curiosity and instead found the school idol Yukino there as a replacement sales person for the leader. Irritated at her awkward service, he decided to help himself, but ended up being mistaken for a salesperson by the other students. One day, Yukino called him up to the rooftop and gave him a stapler. She told him that it was a stapler of eternal bonds.  (Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",1,0,0,1,0

Since whoever gained control of Noah would be able to rule the world, it was decided that the three schools merge together as Hazuki Gakuen and an election held to decide on who will become the world council leader.

The other section, aptly named the magic section, was founded in order to train mages in the art of using magic.  The story begins with Valentine's Day coming up in just a few days and there's a rush for all the girls to get the chocolate they want in order to give it to the boys they like, in accordance with Japanese custom. Haruhi Kamisaka, a mage in training, is out with her friend Anri Hiiragi, also a mage in training, in order to do just this. While walking outside in the park, after buying the chocolate she wanted to give to a boy she met when she was a child, Haruhi meets Yuuma, who stops some younger boys bullying a young girl, and Haruhi thinks that he may be the boy she's been searching for all this time. The next day is Valentine's Day and at school, all the girls are giving their gifts to the boys of their choice. Later that day, Anri challenges Haruhi to a magic battle in order to take the chocolate she has by force for the reason that Haruhi wouldn't tell her who she was going to give it to. Before long, Anri loses control of her magic and it is flown outside, almost falling onto Yuuma and his friends. Ultimately, Haruhi gives him the chocolate she had bought, and in turn Anri does the same, which was her plan - to give her chocolate to the same boy as Haruhi and see who would win his favor more. The next day there is a gas explosion at the magic section of the school and all the mages in training must transfer over to the normal section for the time being. Coincidentally, Haruhi and Anri are placed within Yuuma's class.  Now Haruhi and her friends must adjust to the transfer into the normal section of Mizuhosaka Academy.  (Source: Wikipedia)",1,0,0,0,0

That looked like it might change when he was invited to the Urban Legend Club, a hangout for cute girls who really liked demons and occult mysteries, but it turned out to be much more than that. The girls were Exorcist Knights, and Rick was recruited for his uncanny demon magnetism.  He was bait. How disappointing.  Things always backfired.  While he adjusted to life with the Club, Rick found a discarded book called ""The Tome of Seduction"". Like many urban legends lately it proved that mind control was real, and that minds could be controlled if you knew the right steps. With this book, Rick saw the potential to warp the reality around him.  He was no exorcist, but he could be a hypnotist... master over his teachers, his classmates, and the beautiful girls of the Club.  (Source: dlsite)",1,0,0,0,0

As the first male to become a summoner, Kazuki is under a lot of scrutiny by almost everyone.  To complicate matters, his sister who is a magical swordsman is against him going to summoner school to train there as a summoner. Because summoners and magical swordsman are in conflict where summoners think of magical swordsmen as inferior, his sister naturally is against him going there. She'll stop him even if it means going to war.  Kazuki, however, is determined to thrive in summoner school and is already determined to give it his all. Even if he's the lowest ranked student at Rank E and his fellow students intend to demean him, he'll prove himself as the strongest summoner.  (Source: MU)",14,1,0,1,0

After playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower's parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good.

Meanwhile, at Mihama Academy, the remaining students find themselves with time running out. Due to financial issues, the school is set to close within the month. Over the past year, though, the girls of Mihama have finally begun to find their own legs, thanks to Yuuji's involvement. Are they really just going to bury their heads in the sand and let the world change around them? And are they really willing to let the man who changed their lives slip away without so much as trying to win him back? As the end of their time at Mihama Academy approaches, Amane, Makina, Sachi, Yumiko, and Michiru find themselves arriving at a single conclusion.  How much a group of students can do in the face of countries and organizations far bigger than any individual could hope to be remains to be seen. In the first place, Yuuji's position is far more complicated than any of them could have imagined, as he finds himself embroiled in an elaborate game of super-political chess revolving around both himself and an inconceivable new system slumbering in the depths of CIRS—a system that Yuuji may have more of a connection to than he thinks. One thing is for certain, though—the girls of Mihama are no longer willing to let the world steal things away from them without at least a bit of resistance first. And with help from a mysterious individual known only as Thanatos, they may just achieve their goal...  (Source: VNDB, edited)",1,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, a shinigami comes to kill him, simply because he's a ""forever alone"" sort of guy. When he gasps out his intention of embracing life with his final breaths, though, she takes it back! As long as he follows through on his intentions, he won't be killed.  To convince the shinigami that his plans are genuine, he declares that he will confess to the girl he likes, the very next day.

Wondering if it might not have some monetary value he began to fiddle with it, and unexpectedly it became clear it was a device for inducing hypnosis.
