There, he declares a challenge toward any student and claims he will bring to the ruin the whole school through a series of gambling matches. Nobody knows why he has come to that school or what the real motivations behind his actions are. During any match, Tomu shows off all of his unique coolness and ability. He employs a wide range of tricks, both psychological and physical, to ensure his victory. In any game, you will constantly ask how he's planning to win, why he's really doing certain things, and what's really going on. At the end of the matches, the tricks are revealed, and they all work in real life, even if they do require one to be highly skilled or lucky in order to perform them.

But at times, there are mortals who, whether intentionally or not, kill one of these gods and receive the “curse” of the name “Campione” or God Slayer. Those under this curse gain the power of the god they slayed and receive the mission to obliterate any false god who attempt to take control of any local turf. Godou Kusanagi is one such unlucky human who accidentally killed the Persian deity of victory, Verethragna, and received the powers of the god’s ten forms: Bull, Ram, Camel, White Stallion, Goat, Boar, Raptor, The Wind, The Youth, and The Warrior. But this power draws in all manner of trouble, which is inevitable since the role of a god is ultimately difficult for a human. Yet, one such “trouble” is that this enhanced status has currently attracted three ladies of powerful magic and religious backgrounds, who all wish to aid him in battle. But are they really there to aid him, or do they just wish to find love with him? And what business does the leader of the three, the magic sword-mistress Erica Brandelli, have with these heavily unorthodox activities?

While cleaning out the temple storage, Ushio accidentally unseals the chamber which Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio wisely refused to remove the spear pinning Tora (とら, Japanese for tiger) down, as Tora unwisely makes the strategic blunder of mentioning that the first thing he would do upon being freed would be to devour Ushio; but Tora's unsealed presence attracts various demons to the premises, and Ushio is forced to free Tora in exchange for his help. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life and gobble up Ushio.

In his search for housing, he's introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragi-sou, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn.
